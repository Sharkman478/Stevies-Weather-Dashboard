# Stevies-Weather-Dashboard

Description
* This week we were tasked with creating a working weather forecast website. The task was to use the weather Api that was provided to us and use it to have a 5 day forcast for the next 5 days and also have the current day display the temperature, wind speed, adn the humidity. Along with an icon showing what the weather will look like. We also had to create a search history bar that would be able to be clicked and be used again to find the weather forecast of that input.
